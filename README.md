# A helper to write massive amounts of student comments

## Categories
There are 3 main categories you can use to evaluate your students. These are initially set to `Strengths` `Weaknesses` and `Final`, but can be changed if the text field is edited.

## Factors
Under each category is a list of what I call factors. If you check the checkbox, this factor will be included in the comment output, under its category. So for example if you check the `Participation` factor under `Strengths`, you will see it appear in the comment output, in the Strengths paragraph.

The factor lists are fully customizable, so you can create/edit and delete your own list of factors that you use the most often.


## The student info section has some settings you can use:

### Name: 
student's name, if you write `#name` in your factors, it will automatically be replaced with this

### Gender: 
Male or Female, it will try to replace gender specific pronouns with the correct gender like his/her, himself/herself, etc...

### Save/Load: 
If you like your factors and want to save them for next time, this will download a json file with your settings. Can upload again at a later time. The site should save cookies with your settings, but sometimes they get reset.

### Reset Defaults: 
Reload the original settings.


Happy commenting!
